# Random Message Generator

## Description
This project is a simple JavaScript program that generates random messages by combining different pieces of data. It uses arrays to store different greetings, subjects, and verbs, and then randomly selects one element from each array to create a unique message.

## Usage
To use this program, simply copy and paste the code into a JavaScript file and run it using a JavaScript interpreter or by including it in an HTML file. The generated message will be printed to the console.

## Example Output
Here are some example outputs you might see when running the program:
- "Salut, le monde! reste positif"
- "Hey, ami! passe une bonne journee"
- "Bonjour, tout le monde! garde le sourire"

## Customization
Feel free to customize the arrays with your own greetings, subjects, and verbs to generate messages that suit your needs. You can add or remove elements from the arrays, as well as modify the existing elements.
